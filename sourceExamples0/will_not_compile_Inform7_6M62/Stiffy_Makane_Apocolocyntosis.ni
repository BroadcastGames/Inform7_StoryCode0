Book Three - "Stiffyiana"

Part One - "Conversation"

Chatted_up is a kind of value.  The chatted_ups are conversed and unconversed.  A person has a chatted_up.  A person is usually unconversed.
Fair_warning is a kind of value.  The fair_warnings are warned_about and not_warned_about.  A thing has a fair_warning.  A thing is usually not_warned_about.  A room has a fair_warning.  A room is usually not_warned_about.  A person has a fair_warning.  A person is usually not_warned_about.

Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.

A person has a table-name called conversation.  A person has a text called default reply.  The conversation of a person is the Table of Empty Chatter.  The default reply of a person is "'I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.'"

Check asking someone about something:
	if the noun is the player, instead say "Talking to yourself is said to be a sign of impending mental collapse[71 as a reference].";	
	now the noun is conversed;
	let the source be the conversation of the noun; 
	if topic understood is a topic listed in source and the noun is speakable
	begin; 
		if there is a turn stamp entry and the turn stamp entry is not -1 
		begin; 
			say "[The noun] has already told you that [summary entry]."; 
		otherwise; 
			now turn stamp entry is the turn count; 
			say "[reply entry][paragraph break]"; 
		end if; 
		if the first_conversation is not_warned_about
		begin;
			now the first_conversation is warned_about;
			say "[bracket]";
			say " At any point you can review conversations you have had with the RECAP command. ";
			say "[close bracket]";
			say "[paragraph break]";
		end if;
	otherwise; 
		say "[The default reply of the noun][paragraph break]"; 
	end if;
	stop the action.
	
Understand "recap" or "recap conversation" or "recap conversations" as recalling conversations.

Recalling conversations is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out recalling conversations: 
    let conversants be 0;
    repeat with speaker running through other people
    begin; 
        if the speaker is conversed and the speaker is speakable
        begin;
            let conversants be 1;
            let source be the conversation of the speaker; 
            sort source in turn stamp order; 
            say "You have learned from [the speaker]: [line break]"; 
            let index be 0; 
            repeat through source 
            begin; 
                if there is a turn stamp entry and the turn stamp entry is not -1
                begin; 
                    let index be 1; 
                    say " [summary entry][line break]"; 
                end if; 
            end repeat; 
            if index is 0, say " nothing of any use[line break]"; 
            say paragraph break;
            end if; 
    end repeat;
    If conversants is 0, say "You have not had any meaningful conversations so far.[paragraph break]".

At 80 feet, she's on the small side, with a capacity of roughly 150 tons, or 3,000 [italic type]amphorae[roman type].  She is steered with a pair of steering oars, is built with mortise-and-tenon construction, and has a single mast, rigged with square sails."
--	"Socrates[apostrophe] last words, famously, were 'Sacrifice a cock to Asclepius.'  Now, while generations of philosophers have pretended that this is some sort of high-minded reference to his passage into the world of Platonic Forms, really it was just a crude pun: hemlock, while it's killing you, gives you an erection.  The joke means exactly the same thing it would in English.  Now you know, and knowing is half the battle."
--	"The Greeks and Romans very likely actually did treat gonorrhea with cannabis.  See, for instance, Luigi Arata's 'Nepenthes and Cannabis in Ancient Greece' in [italic type]Janus Head 7/1[roman type], particularly footnote 23."
--	"Gaius Sempronius Gracchus attempted to found a [italic type]colonia[roman type] on the ruins of Carthage in 122 BCE, only 24 years after its destruction.  That attempt was basically unsuccessful, and it was not until Caesar's [italic type]Colonia Junonia[roman type] (which actually didn't really take off until after his death, and thus this characterization of the city may be a bit ahistorical) that the city regained prominence.   However, in short order it was the capital of the province of Africa.  Thus it is probably not much of a stretch to suppose that a certain amount of rebuilding and laying the groundwork for profiteering was going on prior to Caesar's plan."
--	"Please don't ask how it's possible that Stiffy, who clearly was present in Rome during Caesar's dictatorship, could also have been in the ships at Mylae with Stetson.  Maybe the author is affirming the correctness of Book X of the [italic type]Republic[roman type] and an earlier incarnation of Stiffy fought with Stetson.  Or maybe it was just too good a line and image to waste."

--	"Lake Avernus is a volcanic crater filled with water, which makes it an ideal protected harbor.  Julius Caesar began construction of the port here, connecting Avernus to Lake Lucrino with a canal and thence to the sea.  Cocceio's Cave was excavated to allow easy access by chariot to the war fleet housed in Avernus.  The port (Portus Julius) became fully operational in Octavian's reign.  Thus, it is probably slightly ahistorical to have Cocceio's Cave in this story, as it is likely an Augustan, not a Julian work; nevertheless, it's not badly out of place, and it's a really nifty Roman military construction, so in it stays."

Footnotes mentioned is a number that varies.

To say (footnote - a number) as a footnote:
	if the current ponciness is poncy
	begin;
		if footnote > number of filled rows in the Table of Footnotes or footnote < 1
		begin;
			say "Programming error: footnote assignment out of range.";

[Now, in order to let the player view these footnotes, we'll need to parse numbers.]

Understand "footnote [number]" as looking up a footnote.  Understand "note [number]" as looking up a footnote.  Understand "fn [number]" as looking up a footnote.

Looking up a footnote is an action out of world applying to one number.

Check looking up a footnote:
	if the current ponciness is not poncy, say "You must enable ponciness [bracket]PONCY ON[close bracket] before you can look up the footnotes,  you big fruit." instead;
	if the number understood > footnotes mentioned, say "You haven't seen any such footnote." instead;
	if the number understood < 1, say "Footnotes are numbered from 1." instead.

Carry out looking up a footnote:
	choose row with assignment of number understood in the Table of Footnotes;
	if the first_footnote is not_warned_about
	begin;
		 say "[bracket]To disable poncy footnotes, you can type PONCY OFF[close bracket][paragraph break]";

Part Five - "Language"

Chapter One - "An ugly hack"

Before doing anything:
	if the second noun is a person and the noun is not the player
	begin;
		let P be the second noun;
		if P is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from P;
		if P is a man, forcibly set the male pronoun from P;
		if P is neuter, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from P;
	end if;
	if the noun is a person and the noun is not the player
	begin;
		let P be the noun;
		if P is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from P;
		if P is a man, forcibly set the male pronoun from P;
		if P is neuter, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from P;
	end if;
	continue the action.

This is the forcibly set the personal pronoun from multiple object lists rule:
	let CI be the current item from the multiple object list;
	if CI is a person
	begin;
		if CI is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from CI;
		if CI is a man, forcibly set the male pronoun from CI;
		if CI is neuter, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from CI;
	end if;
	continue the activity.
	
The forcibly set the personal pronoun from multiple object lists rule is listed after the set pronouns from items from multiple object lists rule in the action-processing rules.

For printing a locale paragraph about a thing (called the item) (this is the forcibly set the personal pronoun from items in room descriptions rule):
	if the item is a person
	begin;
		if the item is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from the item;
		if the item is male, forcibly set the male pronoun from the item;
		if the item is neuter, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from the item;
	end if;
	continue the activity.
	
For printing a locale paragraph about a thing (called the item) (this is the forcibly set personal pronoun from items on supporters rule):
	if the item is a supporter and the item does not enclose the player
	begin;
		repeat with the possibility running through things on the item
		begin;
			if the possibility is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from the possibility;
			if the possibility is a man, forcibly set the male pronoun from the possibility;
			if the possibility is a neuter animal, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from the possibility;
		end repeat;
	end if;
	continue the activity.
	
To really have the parser notice (O - an object):
	have the parser notice O;
	if O is a woman, forcibly set the female pronoun from O;
	if O is a man, forcibly set the male pronoun from O;
	if O is a neuter animal, forcibly set the neuter pronoun from O.
	
To forcibly set the female pronoun from (O - an object):
	(- (SetPronoun('her', {O} ) ); -).
	
To forcibly set the male pronoun from (O - an object):
	(- (SetPronoun('him', {O} ) ); -).
	
To forcibly set the neuter pronoun from (O - an object):
	(- (SetPronoun('it', {O} ) ); -).

Your gruesome visage fills[emdash]or so it seems to your terrified worshippers[emdash]half the sky, and they prostrate themselves before you, grovelling in the vines.  Your shell splits horribly in a toothy grin, your razor-sharp fangs dripping venom.  Your two eye sockets rip open, revealing the burning coals of hatred within.  A deep, shrieking, ululating cackle erupts from somewhere within your unspeakable vegetal bowels, as, at long last, the milennia-old curse melts from you, and your ability to act suddenly returns.  You wheel in the sky, glaring towards the horizon, as your thoughts turn to Olympus....and revenge.";

Volume Two - "In Medias Res"

The Golden Banana of Discord is a thing.  "[if the golden banana is warned_about]The Golden Banana of Discord glistens with its own ineffable radiance[otherwise]A single metallic banana, in a brass sheath with bronze spots, adorns the very tip of the tree.  This can be nothing other than the Golden Banana of Discord[end if]."  The indefinite article of the golden banana is "the".  The description is "The Golden Banana Of Discord is about ten inches from tip to tip.  It's slightly curved.  [if the golden banana is warned_about]Its brass-and-bronze peel has been split away, revealing the golden fruit within.  In short, a banana, made out of gold[otherwise]You can't actually see whether it's really golden, because it is covered in a brass peel with bronze spots[end if]."

Check eating the golden banana: instead say "It's both metal and a unique holy relic.  Neither one of these things makes it very appetizing."

Check sucking the golden banana: instead say "It's the right shape, but cold and metallic."  Check rubbing the golden banana: instead try wanking off the golden banana.

"The giant jabs at you with the mace, forcing you to retreat towards the edge of the battlement."
"The chieftan sneers.  'I'll distim [italic type]your[roman type] dosh, laddie!' he cries in a barbarically thick accent.  He looks quite pleased with himself for this linguistic feat."

The Lake is a water_room.  "The lake waters are deadly cold.  The craggy southern shore, upon which is perched the Gostak castle, seems impossibly far away.  In all other directions, the lake stretches without visible end."  Up from the lake is nowhere. 

Instead of going south in the Lake: say "You paddle painfully towards shore, but make only the tiniest progress."  Instead of going down in the lake when NN is 0, say "Icy spray lashes your face."  Instead of going down in the lake, say "It seems likely that you'll be headed that way soon enough."  Instead of going north in the lake, say "Perversely, you swim away from the shore, but don't get far in that direction either."   Instead of going west in the lake, say "Swimming parallel to the shore gets you, as expected, neither closer nor farther away from dry land."  Instead of going east in the lake, try going west.

Chapter One - "Love Nest"

Section One - "Love Nest"

The Stiffy Love Nest is a room.  The description is "This is your bedroom; it has been ever since you were a kid.  You've recently redecorated, though.  Green shag carpet gives the floor a certain sophistication.  A nightstand carved with erotic Persian scenes stands next to the bed, which is covered in fine red velvet.  Quotations from Catullus adorn the walls.  A plain wooden door opens on the Atrium to the east."

And shit.  In fact, it's probably a good idea to stop smelling it right about now."  Instead of eating or tasting the carpet, say "Yes, yes, that's a good little rugmuncher."  Instead of rubbing the carpet, say "Ahhhh, the luxurious richness of shag."  Instead of sucking the carpet, try tasting the carpet.  Check taking the carpet: instead try rolling the carpet.

The nightstand is scenery in the Stiffy Love Nest.  It is a supporter.  The description is "This Persian nightstand is made of an exotic dark wood.  It is carved with all manner of erotic scenes: men on women, women on women, men on men, men on gazelles, gazelles on hermaphrodites, gazelles and hermaphrodites on men-in-women's-clothing, and so on.  Really, this is one of the finest things you own."  Understand "smooth", "sensuous", "exotic", "erotic", "dark", "wood", "scenes", "men", "women", "hermaphrodites", "gazelles", "carved", "carven", "carving", "carvings", and "Persian" as the nightstand.  Instead of fucking the nightstand, say "You're demented.  Is it the years of depravity finally catching up to you, or is it the lead water pipes?"  Instead of rubbing the nightstand, say "The dark wood is smooth and sensuous."  Instead of tasting the nightstand, say "It tastes like olive oil."  Instead of smelling the nightstand, say "The nightstand reeks of olive oil."

Not that you ever use it for lighting, but the oil comes in plenty handy."  Understand "olive" and "sweet" as the oil lamp.

Understand "red" and "velvet" as the bed.  Instead of smelling the bed, say "Perfume.  Musk.  Semen.  Olive oil.  Mostly olive oil."  Instead of tasting the bed, say "You would swiftly get pubic hair caught in your teeth, and no one wants that."  Instead of rubbing the bed, say "Mmmm.  Velvet."  Check taking the bed: instead try pushing the bed.  Instead of pushing the bed, say "The bed is fine where it is."  Instead of looking under the bed, say "The mere thought of all the cumrags you've tossed under the bed dissuades you."

The quotations are scenery in the Stiffy Love Nest.  Instead of examining the quotations:
	choose a random row in the Table of Catullus Quotations;
	say "Your eye lights on a quotation at random: '[quotation entry]'  Sexy stuff!".
Understand "Catullus", "Catullan", "quote", "quotes", "wall" and "walls" as quotations.

Table of Catullus Quotations
quotation
"Tam gratum est mihi quam ferunt puellae / pernici aureolum fuisse malum, / quod zonam soluit diu ligatam[45 as a reference]."
"Bononiensis Rufa Rufulum fellat, / uxor Meneni, saepe quam in sepulcretis / uidistis ipso rapere de rogo cenam, / cum deuolutum ex igne prosequens panem / ab semiraso tunderetur ustore[46 as a reference]."
"Mentula conatur Pipleium scandere montem: / Musae furcillis praecipitem eiciunt[47 as a reference]."
"Mentula moechatur. Moechatur mentula? Certe. / Hoc est quod dicunt: ipsa olera olla legit[48 as a reference]."
"Da mi basia mille, deinde centum, / dein mille altera, dein secunda centum, / deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum [49 as a reference]."


Instead of wanking in the Stiffy Love Nest:
	if the stiffycock is not held by the player
	begin;
		say "Out of sight, out of mind."; 
	otherwise;
		let X be the turn count minus the last_wanking_turn;
		if X is less than 50 and the last_wanking_turn is greater than 0
		begin;
			say "You give your schlong a few half-hearted tugs, but you're not really in the mood.";
		otherwise;
			say "With the economy of long practice, you pour a little olive oil from the lamp into your hand, [if the player is not on the bed]perch on the bed, [end if]and quickly rub one out.  Ahhhh.";
			now the last_wanking_turn is the turn count;
			if the small oil lamp is not warned_about
			begin;
				now the small oil lamp is warned_about;

The Atrium is a room.   "The atrium is the heart of the house.  It is a courtyard open to the sky, with covered arcades around each side.  The impluvium fills the center of the room.  The peristyle is off to the north, through the tablinum.  The bustling central street of Ostia is to the south.  Your bedroom door is to the west.

Section One - "Tablinum" 

The Tablinum is a room.  It is north of the Atrium.  "The Tablinum is your father's office.  It is situated between the atrium to the south and the peristyle to the north.

It's not long at all before you groan and deliver what feels like a quart of semen deep into his throat.[paragraph break]";

Although it has been a languishing colony for about eighty years, it's finally started to take off a bit.  It is being refashioned as a central hub for the shipment of African grain to Rome.  At the moment it's a bit of a cross between a burned-out ruin and a boomtown[28 as a footnote].  This is a particularly unlovely section of wharf.  An industrial district is off to the west.  A wide street leads off to the north towards the agora.  The [italic type]Golden Ass[roman type] is anchored to the east."

Some Carthaginians are men in Carthage Docks.  They are ambiguously plural.   The printed name is "passers-by".  They are scenery.

All around you are ship-builders[apostrophe] yards, huge pottery factories churning out thousands of amphorae, silos storing grain for shipment to Rome.  The docks are to the east.  To the south you see a sign over a door advertising a Greek doctor: the traditional symbol of the caduceus with a duck sitting atop it."

Instead of going west in Industrial Wasteland, say "Your way is blocked by the locked gate of a particularly large amphora factory."

Does the player mean doing something with the weed: it is likely.
Instead of rolling the weed:
	if the player encloses the ragged papyrus or the player encloses the jagged papyrus or the player encloses the clean piece of papyrus, say "You suspect that you have better uses for your papyrus than rolling papers.";
	say "You don't have any rolling papers."

Before searching the tombs:
	if the location of the weed is not a room and the stiffycock is diseased and the shabby Greek doctor is warned_about

Book One - "Cumae"

Cumae is a room.  "Cumae is a small but thriving port city, with much to offer the merchant, but not very much of interest to you.  The docks, and [italic type]The Golden Ass[roman type], are at the western edge of the town.  The Sybil's cave is on the shore of Lake Avernus, which is off to the east.  In previous years, this would have required a short hike over a ridge, but now one can proceed through the recently-excavated 'Cocceio's Cave' right through the hill to the lake shore."

Book Two - "Cocceio's Cave"

Cocceio's Cave is east of Cumae.  "Cocceio's Cave runs arrow-straight from the town of Cumae, to the west, to the shore of Lake Avernus, to the east.  It is a kilometer long and wide enough for two wagons to pass one another.  It has recently been excavated on Caesar's orders[30 as a footnote], but it also makes for a very convenient road for petitioners seeking the Sybil.  Regularly spaced torches light your way."

The scenery_torches are scenery in Cocceio's Cave.  The printed name is "torches".  The description is "Sputtering torches in iron sconces light the passage."  They are ambiguously plural.

Cocceio's Cave runs back to the west through the hillside.  To the south is the trapezoidal mouth of the Sybil's Grotto, and at your feet opens the gently smoking pit that leads to Hades."

Instead of going down in Lake Avernus for the first time, say "A ghostly voice inside your head mutters:[line break][italic type]facilis descensus Averno;[line break]noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis;[line break]sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,[line break]hoc opus, hic labor est[roman type][63 as a reference].[paragraph break]This unnerves you enough that you choose not to descend."

death-message			narrative
"You have fallen to your death"	"You soon lose the trail in the insanely thick underbrush.  Struggling and forcing your way through thickets, you finally shove through a particularly vicious briar patch into open air, and plummet several hundred feet to a painful, but mercifully quick, demise"
"You have been eaten by beasts"	"Within minutes of pushing into the jungle you are hopelessly lost.  Shoving your way through briars, you stagger aimlessly for hours.  Eventually, night falls.  It's unclear whether your assailants are grues or some other kind of beasts, but in any event, their teeth are sharp enough"
"You have been poisoned by a viper"	"Struggling through the bush, you reach out to steady yourself on a convenient vine.  Alas, it is no vine, but a viper, and takes a dim view of your groping"
"You have been brained by a chimpanzee"	"As you push through the forest, you feel eyes watching you, but try as you might, you can't see anything.  The farther you go, the deeper the woods get, and you think you begin to see black, hairy shapes swinging through the branches at the corners of your vision.  Finally you pause exhausted by a large tree.  There is a terrible hooting, and something drops from the canopy in front of you.  Your last impression is of black hair, long yellow teeth, and a long arm swinging a thighbone into your skull"

The initial appearance is "A hideous, giant, frog-like creature[emdash]if frogs were the size of elephants and festooned with tentacles[emdash]floats here in the dark water, regarding you with slitted red eyes."  It is unspeakable.  The default reply of the Lake Guardian is "The creature makes no sound."  The description is "The beast is at least nine feet wide, and floats on the water like a huge, flattened toad, lazily swishing its many tentacles.  It watches you with unblinking red eyes."

Instead of giving or showing the sugar cane to the Lake Guardian:
	say "The tongue coils around the cane four times, and then jerks it back towards the mouth.  The creature somehow gets the cane caught diagonally in its huge lipless mouth, wedging it open.  Dark water rushes in, and in a sudden whirlpool of bubbles, the beast disappears from sight into the blackness of the lake.";
	remove the Lake Guardian from play;
	remove the sugar cane from play;
	now the froghemoth clock is 1.

.
	
This is the guardian-gulping rule:

	end the story saying "You have been devoured by the Guardian of the Lake".

Part Two - "Dice"

Section One - "Definitions"

[ The dice mechanics are stolen from The Reliques of Tolti-Aph ]

[* RPGs are games of chance as well as skill, and the actual rolling of the dice is as much a part of the experience as the randomised outcome. The polyhedral four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twenty- and even hundred-sided dice ubiquitous to RPGs are pleasingly exotic in the hand, but also make possible a wide range of random distributions. W&W uses the traditional notation for such rolls (which evolved as the D&D rules went through successive printings, but became standard around 1980): "3d6+2" means we should roll three six-sided dice, add up the scores showing, then add 2.]

[ The dice code is further based on Benjamin Penney's "To Hit", posted to rec.arts.int-fiction on 19 June 2010]

A die roll is a kind of value. 9d100+29 specifies a die roll with parts dice, sides (without leading zeros), modifier (without leading zeros, optional, preamble optional).

A singular die roll is a kind of value. d100+29 specifies a singular die roll with parts sides (without leading zeros), modifier (without leading zeros, optional, preamble optional).

A subtractive die roll is a kind of value. 9d100-29 specifies a subtractive die roll with parts dice, sides (without leading zeros), modifier (without leading zeros, optional, preamble optional).

A singular subtractive die roll is a kind of value. d100-29 specifies a singular subtractive die roll with parts sides (without leading zeros), modifier (without leading zeros, optional, preamble optional).

[* The optional nature of the adds part of a die roll means that "2d4", for instance, is also a legal form. Again, this is a convention imitating the tables which appear in printed RPG rulebooks. What Inform means by the preamble to the adds part is the plus sign: if this had not been  specified to be optional, "2d4+" would be legal.]                              
                                                                                
[* We added the pointless verb "roll" as a harmless convenience for testing that die rolls work: if the player types "ROLL 3D6+2", the game might reply "For your own amusement, you roll 3d6+2: 2,5,4+2=13, making thirteen."]

Understand "roll [singular die roll]" as test_rolling singular. Understand "dice [singular die roll]" as test_rolling singular. Understand "shoot [singular die roll]" as test_rolling singular. Understand "throw [singular die roll]" as test_rolling singular. test_rolling singular is an action applying to one singular die roll.

Instead of an actor test_rolling singular value (called the roll), try the actor test_rolling the die roll with dice part 1 sides part (the sides part of the roll) modifier part (the modifier part of the roll) instead.

Understand "roll [subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling subtractive. Understand "dice [subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling subtractive. Understand "shoot [subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling subtractive. Understand "throw [subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling subtractive. test_rolling subtractive is an action applying to one subtractive die roll.

Instead of an actor test_rolling subtractive value (called the roll), try the actor test_rolling the die roll with dice part (0 minus the dice part of the roll) sides part (0 minus the sides part of the roll) modifier part (0 minus the modifier part of the roll) instead.

Understand "roll [singular subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling singular subtractive. Understand "dice [singular subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling singular subtractive. Understand "shoot [singular subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling singular subtractive. Understand "throw [singular subtractive die roll]" as test_rolling singular subtractive. test_rolling singular subtractive is an action applying to one singular subtractive die roll. 

Instead of an actor test_rolling singular subtractive value (called the roll), try the actor test_rolling the die roll with dice part -1 sides part (0 minus the sides part of the roll) modifier part (0 minus the modifier part of the roll) instead.

test_rolling is an action out of world applying to one die roll. 

Understand "roll [die roll]" as test_rolling.  Understand "dice [die roll]" as test_rolling. Understand "shoot [die roll]" as test_rolling.  Understand "throw [die roll]" as test_rolling.

test_rolling craps is an action out of world applying to nothing.
Understand "roll" as test_rolling craps when the polyhedra are visible.  Understand "dice" as test_rolling craps.  Understand "shoot" as test_rolling craps when the polyhedra are visible. 

The craps-point is a number that varies.  The craps-point is 0.

To decide what number is the modulus of (n - a number):
	if n is less than 0
	begin;
		decide on 0 minus n;
	otherwise;
		decide on n;
	end if.

To say (d - a number) die/dice with (ss - a number) sides adding (m - a number):
        say "[if d is not 1][d][end if]d[ss][if m is greater than 0]+[m][otherwise if m is less than 0][m][end if]".


To decide what number is the roll of (d - a number) die/dice with (ss - a number) sides adding (m - a number):
	let the total be m;
	say "[if d is not 1][d][end if]d[ss][if m is greater than 0]+[m][otherwise if m is less than 0][m][end if]: ";
	repeat with counter running from 1 to d

Part Three - "Cheating"

The Stiffy Makane figurine is a figurine on the Great Table.  The description is "The figurine representing Stiffy Makane lies face-down in a lake in the north of Scotland.  He's dead."  The name is "Stiffy Makane".  Before taking the Stiffy Makane figurine for the first time, say "You glance around furtively.  No one seems to be watching as you pick up the figurine."  The mine of the Stiffy Makane figurine is true.  After taking the Stiffy Makane figurine, now the description of the Stiffy Makane figurine is  "This is a rather accurately-rendered lead miniature of Stiffy Makane; he wears a toga and clutches the Golden Banana of DIscord."  Understand "toga", "banana", "gold", and "golden" as the Stiffy Makane Figurine.  Does the player mean doing something other than drinking with the Stiffy Makane figurine: it is very likely.  It is male.

Before inserting the Stiffy Makane figurine into something:
	if the second noun is Model_hades
	begin;

	end if.
	
Before putting the Stiffy Makane figurine on the Great Table:
	consider the you-are-busted rule;

	say paragraph break;
	say paragraph break;
	really have the parser notice the crystal skull;
	now the player is Stiffy Makane.
	
This is the you-are-busted rule:
	if Argus is boinked
	begin;

This is the sort-of-busted rule:
	if Argus is boinked
	begin;

	otherwise;
		if Argus is warned_about
		begin;

			consider the howdy-argus rule;
		end if;
		stop the action;
	end if.
	
This is the howdy-argus rule:
	if the last place checked is 1
	begin;
		say "Argus straightens up from under the table[if the Great Table is handled].  'Oh, don't look so surprised,' he says.  'I hid there while you were checking the curtains[otherwise].  'You really ought to pay more attention to your surroundings[end if].  [run paragraph on]";

	end if;
	say "How very, very naughty, Eris,' he gloats.  'Cheating.  Cheating at the Great Game.  Why, that's the sort of thing that could get you in real trouble with your fellow deities.  I bet they'd be very, very angry to hear about this.  Maybe there's some way,' he leers at you, 'that we could negotiate some deal so I don't tell them about it.'  From between two of his many eyes, an erect penis suddenly protrudes.  Argus gestures at it, and raises some of his eyebrows.";
	now Argus's erection is part of Argus;
	now Argus's eyes are part of Argus;
	move Argus to the Game Room;
	Now the description of Argus is "Hundred-eyed Argus watches you from twenty or thirty of them.  An incongruous penis protrudes from between two of his eyes.";
	now Argus is warned_about.

Some all_figurines are scenery_figurines on the Great Table.  Understand "figurines" and "figurine" as all_figurines.  The printed name is "figurines".  The description is "Many figurines dot the table.  You can see [if the Stiffy Makane figurine is enclosed by the Great Table]Stiffy Makane, [end if][if the Julius Caesar figurine is on the Great Table]Julius Caesar, [end if]Baldanders, a hippo, and the Mweru Bird, among others."  Does the player mean doing something with the all_figurines: it is likely.  They are male.  Check drinking the all_figurines: instead say "Fortunately for all concerned, the ambient temperature in the Game Room is still far below the melting point of lead."
The Julius Caesar figurine is a scenery_figurine on the Great Table.  The description is "Caesar lies crumpled on the Forum steps."  The printed name is "Julius Caesar".

A Mweru bird figurine is a scenery_figurine on the Great Table.  The description is "At one point, there was a very impressive lead figurine of the Mweru Bird, which used to look more classically roc-like and vulture-ish.  Somehow, it got lost, so now the bird is represented by a somewhat threadbare stuffed canary."  Understand "canary", "threadbare", "stuffed", "vulture", "roc", and "parakeet" as the mweru bird figurine.  Check taking the mweru bird figurine when the player is Divine Eris: instead say "The less you handle it, the better; one of the legs is going to fall off any day now, and you don't want to be responsible for having to put it back on."

Instead of sucking, touching, rubbing, fucking, blowing, kissing, or wanking off Argus's erection, try fucking Argus.

Instead of sucking, touching, rubbing, fucking, blowing, kissing, or wanking off Argus:
	say "With a resigned sigh, you squat down and go to work on Argus's penis.  His ejaculation is surprisingly quick.  Before you can get up, though, another hard-on pops up between two different eyes.  'Oh,' smirks Argus.  'I probably should have mentioned.  I have a hundred of [italic type]these[roman type] too.'  You descend into what is basically a demented game of Whack-a-Mole.  Several hours later, you're finally done, sore in every orifice, your throat raw, your hands a mass of blisters, your wings and hair beslimed with god-spooge.[paragraph break]Argus folds his hands across his chest.

The dog's ears[emdash]all six of them[emdash]are black and floppy.  The central head is the largest, perhaps two yards across with fearsome fangs and gallons of drool.

Understand "central", "center", "centre", "middle", and "head" as Golem.

"The right head mounts a vicious attack on both the center and left ones, and briefly manages to grab the arm.  Then the arm falls from its jaws as the head essays another stanza of frenetic barking.  The expression on the left head can only be called a smirk."
"The center head takes advantage of the hatred of the right and left heads for each other to try to take the arm.  It gets its nose bitten by the [if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds]left[otherwise]right[end if] head and whines piteously."
"The left head feints and briefly manages to get the right head to attack the center head, which was in the way.  It attempts to use this time to grab the arm, but the right head is wise to the trick, and blocks the left one, snapping."
"The right head triumphantly grabs the arm, only to release it as the left head bites its cheek and the center head cowers."
"All three of the heads glare at one another, growling deep in their throats."

Part Fifteen - "Mud"

Chapter One - "Mud"

After examining Tantalus:
	if Tantalus is unboinked
	begin;
		Increase the Tantalus-taunt-counter by 1;

		begin;
			say "'Come to gloat?' the man says. 'Why not? After all, you put me here.'  How odd.  Did you?  Anyway, you're pretty sure this is Tantalus.";
			now Tantalus is handled;
			now the printed name of Tantalus is "Tantalus";
		end if;

		if the Tantalus-taunt-counter is 3, say "The man laughs softly. 'Not long now.'  He grins sarcastically. 'An interesting end, don't you think? Jiminy Cricket never had such an exit scene.'";
		if the Tantalus-taunt-counter is 4, say "Resignation and more than a little bitterness fill the man's face. 'Go on,' he says. 'You've work to do, pieces to recover.'  He pauses, then yells, 'Go on, I said!'  Then, muttered, 'You've ignored me too long to do anything about it now.'";
	end if.

Instead of kicking or attacking Tantalus for the first time, say "A pointed rumble of nearby thunder dissuades you."
	
Instead of kicking or attacking Tantalus:
	say "The head's eyes widen as you draw your foot back. 'Stiffy, no, please, oh gods you can't[emdash]' His cries are cut short as your foot slams into him. With the sound of eggshells cracking, the head fragments into countless pieces which are quickly lost in the mud.";
	remove Tantalus from play;
	say "[paragraph break][paragraph break]Suddenly you sink into the mud yourself.  Up to your neck, in fact.  It's a long few centuries until someone kicks your own head in.";
	end the story saying "You have been enmired".
	
Instead of pulling Tantalus:
	say "You lean over him, place your hands over his ears, and pull. He shrieks in pain, eyes squeezed shut. You quickly determine that he cannot be pulled free of the mud. When you let go the man's ears are bright red."
	
Instead of pushing Tantalus:
	say "You lean over him, place your hands on his forehead, and push. Hard. He screams, eyes squeezed shut, as you bear down on his head. When you stop you see that you have left a fiery red handprint on his forehead which is slow to fade."
	
Instead of digging Tantalus:
	say "You kneel and begin scooping mud from around the head with both hands. As fast as you remove the mud, more mud and water return. 'Forget it,' the man says gruffly. 'It's too late now.'  He seems strangely touched by your attempt, however."

Check taking Tantalus:
	instead say "You grab hold of his ears, but before you can pull, the head says, 'It's no good now. I'm done for.'  His eyes narrow at you. 'The least you can do is feel guilty.'"

Instead of giving or showing the wineskin to Tantalus when Tantalus is unboinked, say "The head spits.  'Hey, some diabetic harpy called.  She wants her menses back.'";  [* Too bad we can't actually ever get here. ]

Instead of showing the fine Falernian wine to Tantalus, say "The head glares at you.  'Nice.  It's not enough to put me here, now you have to taunt me.  Blow me.'"

Instead of pouring the fine Falernian wine on Tantalus, try giving the wine to Tantalus.

Instead of giving the fine Falernian wine to Tantalus:
	now Tantalus is boinked;
	remove the fine Falernian wine from play;
	really have the parser notice the jug of vinegar;
	say "You hold the bottle to the head's lips and pour.  He guzzles the wine greedily.  After the last drop is consumed, you drop the bottle into the mud, where it disappears. [paragraph break]'Whoa, thanks,' says the man.  He smacks his lips and belches.  'Take the vinegar if you want it.  I don't care.'".

Instead of showing or giving something to Tantalus:
	if Tantalus is boinked
	begin;
		say "The head rolls its eyes blearily.  'Don't care.'";
	otherwise;
		say "The man rolls his eyes.  'Is that the best you can think of?'";
	end if.

Instead of asking Tantalus about anything when Tantalus is boinked, say "The head drunkenly chants 'La-la-la!  I can't hear you; I've got mud in my ears!  La-la-la!'".
