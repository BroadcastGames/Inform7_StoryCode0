Highlights:
    1. "I was forced to write a Makefile, just for this project. It creates a temporary directory containing the minimum structure necessary to convince the compiler to run, then runs it based on copying what the IDE reports having done. It works on my machine!"
	2. frotz vs. dfrotz for shell execution
	

Inform 7 in Python?

"If you like, grab http://www.fsf.net/~adam/i7.py -- this is a file
which you can drop in place of /usr/local/bin/i7 after unpacking the
i386 CLI I7 drop onto your XO. It's my first actual Python program and
about all I will vouch for is "it works for me." If you've been having
trouble with pathnames and such on the CLI version (some Red Hat users)
and you have Python on your Linux box, this might be worth a try for you
as well."

Linux, Ubuntu
===================
Ubuntu 16.04 official repository comes with an outdated verison of the Inform 6 compiler. You can use the binary from the Inform 7 IDE, or try to compile it.

Makefile is not currently on the repository:
